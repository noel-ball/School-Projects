This enables you to catch any error you might have introduced, and not noticed, due to your running cells out of order. \n","* Second, download the notebook in .ipynb format (File > Download .ipynb) and upload the .ipynb file to [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScUrPXRZZn2naEdS3pHAT3QozeSZfwzHOc-fdvItAHiGte_fw/viewform?usp=sf_link).

You need to complete every place marked: \n","\n","    `# YOUR CODE HERE`\n","    \n","    and you should not modify any other place. \n","* One or more test cells.  Each cell is worth some number of points, marked at the top.  You should not modify these tests cells.  The tests pass if no error is printed out: when there is a statement that says, for instance: \n","\n","    `assert x == 2`\n","    \n","    then the test passes if `x` has value 2, and fails otherwise.  You can insert a `print(x)` (for this case!) somewhere if you want to debug your work; it is up to you.  \n","    \n","### Notes:\n","\n","* Your code will be tested both according to the tests you can see (the `assert` statements you can see), _and_ additional tests.  This prevents you from hard-coding the answer to the particular questions posed.  Your code should solve the _general_ intended case, not hard-code the particular answer for the values used in the tests. \n","\n","* **Please do not delete or add cells!** The test is autograded, and if you modify the test by adding or deleting cells, even if you re-add cells you delete, you may not receive credit. \n","\n","* **Please do not import modules that are not part of the [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html).** You do not need any, and they will likely not available in the grading environment, leading your code to fail. \n","\n","* **If you are inactive too long, your notebook might get disconnected from the back-end.** Your work is never lost, but you have to re-run all the cells before you continue. \n","\n","* You can write out print statements in your code, to help you test/debug it. But remember: the code is graded on the basis of what it outputs or returns, not on the basis of what it prints.\n","\n","* **TAs and tutors have access to this notebook,** so if you let them know you need their help, they can look at your work and give you advice. \n","\n","### Grading\n","\n","Each cell where there are tests is worth a certain number of points.  You get the points allocated to a cell only if you pass _all_ the tests in the cell. \n","\n","The tests in a cell include both the tests you can see, and other, similar, tests that are used for grading only.  Therefore, you cannot hard-code the solutions: you really have to solve the essence of the problem, to receive the points in a cell. \n","\n","### Code of Conduct\n","\n","* Work on the test yourself, alone. \n","* You can search documentation on the web, on sites such as the Python documentation sites, Stackoverflow, and similar, and you can use the results. \n","* You cannot share your work with others or solicit their help.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"nbgrader":{"cell_type":"markdown","checksum":"0ef20cbbd3a48aca1bf55cfe5174e212","grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-d5abdd88305393b4","locked":true,"schema_version":3,"solution":false},"id":"VIKVEcA5BeDB"},"source":["In the previous chapter, on a particular run of the scheduler for pasta carbonara, I got:\n","\n","```\n","['dice pancetta',\n"," 'fill pot with water',\n"," 'put eggs in bowl',\n"," 'put pancetta in pan',\n"," 'dice onions',\n"," 'put oil and butter in pan',\n"," 'bring pot of water to a boil',\n"," 'add salt to water',\n"," 'put pasta in water',\n"," 'beat eggs',\n"," 'put onions in pan',\n"," 'colander pasta',\n"," 'cook pancetta',\n"," 'serve']\n","```\n","\n","This not only makes little sense; it violates the first axiom of making pasta, which states that pasta must be served as soon as fully cooked.

Consider for instance our timed scheduling problem: it models only partially how one can cook.  For instance, people generally cannot slice two things at once: if there's only one person, some tasks, such as slicing, become mutually exclusive.  One may also have limitations on how many things can be cooked at the same time.  These are known, in general, as resource constraints on a schedule.  Schedules can have other types of constraints too: particular tasks may be able to be started only after predetermined times, and so forth. \n","For the two problems we have seen, scheduling with dependencies, and with duration constraints, efficient optimal solutions are known. \n","For complex scheduling problems, it is often the case that such efficient solutions are not available, and one must write algorithms that search for a solution, often with the help of heuristics.
