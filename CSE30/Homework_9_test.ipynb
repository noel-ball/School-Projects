Here is a short summary: \n","\n","### Submitting your work\n","\n","To submit your work: \n","\n","* First, click on \"Runtime > Restart and run all\", and check that you get no errors.  This enables you to catch any error you might have introduced, and not noticed, due to your running cells out of order. \n","* Second, download the notebook in .ipynb format (File > Download .ipynb) and upload the .ipynb file to [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScdykHU8AZuWfqRZj0lBRuBOzgqyipNHt_QC1p3iY7w9iGHnw/viewform?usp=sf_link).\n","\n","You can submit multiple times; the last submission before the deadline is the one that counts. This homework is due by **11:59pm on Tuesday 10 May, 2022**.\n","\n","### Homework format\n","\n","For each question in this notebook, there is: \n","\n","* A text description of the problem. \n","* One or more places where you have to insert your solution.  You need to complete every place marked: \n","\n","    `# YOUR CODE HERE`\n","    \n","    and you should not modify any other place. \n","* One or more test cells.  Each cell is worth some number of points, marked at the top.  You should not modify these tests cells.  The tests pass if no error is printed out: when there is a statement that says, for instance: \n","\n","    `assert x == 2`\n","    \n","    then the test passes if `x` has value 2, and fails otherwise.  You can insert a `print(x)` (for this case!) somewhere if you want to debug your work; it is up to you.  \n","    \n","### Notes:\n","\n","* Your code will be tested both according to the tests you can see (the `assert` statements you can see), _and_ additional tests.  This prevents you from hard-coding the answer to the particular questions posed.  Your code should solve the _general_ intended case, not hard-code the particular answer for the values used in the tests. \n","\n","* **Please do not delete or add cells!** The test is autograded, and if you modify the test by adding or deleting cells, even if you re-add cells you delete, you may not receive credit. \n","\n","* **Please do not import modules that are not part of the [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html).** You do not need any, and they will likely not available in the grading environment, leading your code to fail. \n","\n","* **If you are inactive too long, your notebook might get disconnected from the back-end.** Your work is never lost, but you have to re-run all the cells before you continue. \n","\n","* You can write out print statements in your code, to help you test/debug it. But remember: the code is graded on the basis of what it outputs or returns, not on the basis of what it prints.\n","\n","* **TAs and tutors have access to this notebook,** so if you let them know you need their help, they can look at your work and give you advice. \n","\n","### Grading\n","\n","Each cell where there are tests is worth a certain number of points.  You get the points allocated to a cell only if you pass _all_ the tests in the cell. \n","\n","The tests in a cell include both the tests you can see, and other, similar, tests that are used for grading only.  Therefore, you cannot hard-code the solutions: you really have to solve the essence of the problem, to receive the points in a cell. \n","\n","### Code of Conduct\n","\n","* Work on the test yourself, alone. \n","* You can search documentation on the web, on sites such as the Python documentation sites, Stackoverflow, and similar, and you can use the results. \n","* You cannot share your work with others or solicit their help.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"nbgrader":{"cell_type":"markdown","checksum":"550f3f82346323117e9a38e874e61cee","grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-dc5c9a288c96a6da","locked":true,"schema_version":3,"solution":false},"id":"afAmnNG2ttnq"},"source":["We will develop a data structure to represent arithmetic expressions containing variables, such as $3 + 4$ or $2 + x * (1 - y)$.  \n","\n","What is an expression?

For instance, the two expressions `(\"+\", \"x\", 1)` and `(\"-\", (*, 2, \"x\"), \"x\")` are not structurally equal, but they are equal in values.  \n","\n","How can we test for value equality of expressions?  There are two ways: the high road, and the pirate road. Of course, we take the pirate road.  \n","\n","The high-road approach consists in trying to demonstrate, in some way, that the two expressions are equal.  One way of doing so would be to define a set of [rewriting rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewriting) for expressions, that try to transform one expression into the other; this would mimick the process often done by hand to show that two expressions are equal.  Another way would be to use theorem provers that can reason about expressions and real numbers, such as [PVS](https://pvs.csl.sri.com).  The problem is that these approaches are a lot of work.  Is there a way to be lazy, and still get the job done? \n","\n","There is, it turns out.  Suppose you have two expressions $f, g$ containing variable $x$ only.  The idea is that if $f$ and $g$ are built with the usual operators of algebra, it is exceedingly unlikely for $f$ and $g$ to give the same value  many values of $x$, and yet not be always equal.  This would not be true if our expressions could contain if-then-else statements, but for the operators we defined so far, it holds.  Indeed, one could be more precise, and try to come up with a theorem of the form: \n","\n","> If $f$ and $g$ have \"zerosity\" $n$, and are equal for $n+1$ values of $x$, then they are equal for all values of $x$. \n","\n","We could then try to define the \"zerosity\" of an expression to make this hold: for example, for two polynomials of degree at most $d$, once you show that they are equal for $d+1$ points, they must be equal everywhere ([why?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra)).  But this again would be a smart approach, and we are trying to see if we can solve the problem while being as stupid as possible.  So our idea will simply be: pick 1000 values of $x$ at random; if the two expressions are equal for all the values, then they must be equal everywhere.  This is a somewhat special case of a [Monte Carlo method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method), a method used to estimate the probability of complex phenomena (where expression equality is our phenomenon).\n","\n","There are only two wrinkles with this.  The first is that an expression can contain many variables, and we have to try to value assignments for all of the variables.  This is easy to overcome; we just need some helper function that gives us the set of variables in a function.  The second wrinkle is: how do we generate the possible value assignments?  How big do these values need to be on average?  According to what probability distribution?  We could dive into a lot of theory and reasoning about how to compute appropriate probability distributions, but since our goal is to be stupid, we will use one of the simplest distributions with infinite domain: the Gaussian one.
