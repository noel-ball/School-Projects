You need to complete every place marked: \n","\n","    `# YOUR CODE HERE`\n","    \n","    and you should not modify any other place. \n","* One or more test cells.  Each cell is worth some number of points, marked at the top.  You should not modify these tests cells.  The tests pass if no error is printed out: when there is a statement that says, for instance: \n","\n","    `assert x == 2`\n","    \n","    then the test passes if `x` has value 2, and fails otherwise.

If we used a list, rather than a set, in any unit test suite we would have to: \n","\n","* Check that every element appears only once in the list; \n","* sort the list of results before comparing it with the expected results, to ensure that different orders of elements in the returned list do not cause the test to fail. \n","\n","In general, it is quite important to choose as types for variables or return values, a type that expresses as best as possible the intended properties of the value.\n","\n","Another thing: we want to define `available_colors` so that it is a _property_ rather than a method.
